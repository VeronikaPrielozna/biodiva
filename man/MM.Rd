\usage{
mm.eco(x, first.col=2, table=1, graph=1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data}

\item{first.col}{the column from which to work with the data}

\item{table}{creating table}

\description{
Calculation of species richness indices (Margalef's and Menhinick's index)
}
\details{
The function mm.eco provides the calculations of Margalef's (DMg) and Menhinick's (DMm) index for uploaded dataset (x). With dataset is worked from the user's specified column (first.col=2). This function returns tabular (table=T) and graphical outputs (graph=T). Users can set the outputs as:
1 = table and graph are made for both indices
2 = table and graph are made only for Margalef's index
3 = table and graph are made only for Menhinick's index
}
\examples{
mm.eco(x)
mm_index.eco(x, table = 2, graph = 2)
mm_index.eco(x, table = 3, graph = 3)
